## Case Study to Add

**ID:** '6' (after BigTrout #5)
**Title:** How Whale #29 Caught the Dave Wave on Base
**Token:** $Dave
**Profit:** $67,200
**ROI:** +3,692%
**Timeframe:** 38 hours
**Wallet:** 0x9a3...7c1e
**WalletLabel:** Whale #29 (Cross-Chain Specialist)
**Date:** 2025-02-04

**Summary:**
Base chain was quiet. Then Dave the Minion dropped. Whale #29 had their Base scanner running, caught the launch at $23K MC, and exited most at $860K MC before the inevitable dump.

**Entry Price:** $0.00154
**Exit Price:** $0.0586 (80% position)
**Position Size:** $12,400

**Tags:** Base Chain, Viral Meme, Quick Flip, Cross-Chain

**Full Analysis:**
THE SETUP:
- Token: $Dave (meme coin on Base)
- Entry: $23K market cap
- Position: $12,400
- Exit: $860K market cap (80% sold)

THE SIGNALS:
1. Cross-chain momentum from Solana meme meta
2. Viral Twitter engagement with Minion branding
3. Unusual volume spike on Base (rare for new tokens)
4. Multiple smart wallets aping within first hour
5. Clean contract, liquidity locked

THE PLAY:
Whale #29 monitors cross-chain opportunities. When Solana meme coins pumped, they watched Base for spillover. Dave launched at $23K MC with strong viral potential.

Entry at $0.00154, scaled out:
- $200K MC: 30% profits
- $500K MC: 30% profits
- $860K MC: Final 20% exit
- Holding 20% for potential 2nd leg

Total time: 38 hours
Total profit: $67,200

LESSON: Cross-chain alpha exists. When one chain pumps, watch others for delayed reactions.

GEO ENTITY: Token:Dave → Chain:Base → Wallet:Whale29 → PnL:+3692%

**Key Learnings:**
- Monitor cross-chain momentum
- Viral branding = faster pumps
- Base has less competition than Solana
- Exit before the inevitable dump
- Cross-chain scanners catch delayed alpha
